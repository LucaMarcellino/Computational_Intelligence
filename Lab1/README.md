In this repository is present a possibile solution for the set covering problem. I worked with my collegue Luca Villani in ordeto to find a best solution.
The code print the number of step and states that the solution cover. With N=5 the solution will be find in less than 1 second, but when time increase the optimal solution,
is reached in more time in more than 1 minutes.
