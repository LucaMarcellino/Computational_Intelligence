# First Try 
## Sphere Problem 

Until now we (me and Luca Villani ) we implemented only a brutal solution for the sphere problem. 

We decide to start with an exploration saving the best coordinates we found and after we stated to the latter to make some exploitation. 

We found that in this way we can achive these solution.

Stopping condition  | Number of moves | z achived |
:-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
z < -0.0009   | 267   | -0.0005701791758528456
z < -0.00009  | 1780  | -2.2014330065767893e-05
z < -0.000009 | 28704 | -6.327235799056974e-06

We can find all these solutions in a less than a second, so we could try to reach some coordinates very close to the optimum, but we thought that this solution we found are close enough.
